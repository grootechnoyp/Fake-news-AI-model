1,Introduction,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
After,the,manipulation,of,opinions,,on,Facebook,during,the,2016,U.S.,election,"[2],",the,interest,in,the,topic,of,fake
news has increased substantially.,,,,,"Unfortunately, the distribution of fakes leads not only to misinformation of readers",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but,also,to,more,severe,consequences.,There,was,a,case,when,the,spread,of,rumor,about,Hillary,Clinton,leading,,
a,child,sex,trafﬁcking,lead,to,Washington,Pizzeria,[3].,"Moreover,",due,to,the,global,pandemic,in,2020,,there,was,a
simultaneous emergence of infodemic [4] that could lead to even worse epidemiological situation and harm people’s,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
health dramatically.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As a result, fake news received tremendous public attention, as well as drawn increasing interest from the academic",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
community.,,"Multiple supervised fake news detection models were proposed based on linguistic features [5, 6]; deep",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
learning,models,,"[7,","8,","9,",10];,or,signals,from,social,networks,"[11,",12].,One,of,the,directions,of,the,supervised
approaches,,is,to,use,additional,information,from,the,Web,"[13,","14,",15].,"However,",in,these,works,only,monolingual,,
signals were taken into account.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In our work, we assume that viral spreading of (fake) information may naturally hit the “language barrier” and cross-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
checking of facts across medias in various languages (supposed to be strongly independent) could yield an additional,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
signal.,We aim to close this gap and perform an exploration of cross-lingual Web features to fake news detection.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The contributions of our work are the follows:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
•,Multiverse:,,the,new,cross-lingual,,evidence,,feature,for,fake,news,detection,,based,on,multilingual,news,,
,veriﬁcation is proposed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
•,We conducted manual experiment based on cross-lingual dataset markup to evaluate if the user can use such,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,feature for misinformation identiﬁcation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
*Extended version of,,,[1],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Multilingual Evidence for Fake News Detection,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,•,We explored several strategies for cross-lingual content similarity estimation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,•,We compared fake news classiﬁcation systems based on the proposed feature with several baselines achieving,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,SOTA results.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2,Related Work,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A,substantial,,amount,of,research,has,been,done,in,the,ﬁeld,of,fake,news,"detection,",which,includes,the,creation,of
datasets and methods.,,,,"In this section, we perform a comprehensive analysis of the prior art related to the subject of this",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
article.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2.1,Users Behaviour Towards Fake News Detection,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Firstly, before the discussion of automatic machine fake news detection methods, we want to analyze the case of how",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
real-life users react to fake information and in which way they check the veracity of information.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In [16] a very broad analysis of users’ behavior was obtained.,,,,,,,,,,,The authors found out that when people try to check,,,,,,,,,
"information credibility they rely on a limited set of features, such as:",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,•,Is this information compatible with other things I believe to be true?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,•,Is this information internally coherent?,,,,,,Do the pieces form a plausible story?,,,,,,,,,,,,
,•,Does it come from a credible source?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,•,Do other people believe it?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So,",people can rely on the text of the news and its source and their judgment.,,,,,,,,,,,,,"However,",if they get enough internal,,,,,
"motivation,",,they,can,also,refer,to,some,external,sources,for,evidence,,seeking.,These,external,sources,can,be,some,
knowledge sources or other people.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The conclusions from [17] repeat the previous results:,,,,,,,,,,individuals rely on both their judgment of the source and the,,,,,,,,,,
"message, and when this does not adequately provide a deﬁnitive answer, they turn to external resources to authenticate",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
news.,The intentional and institutional reaction was seeking conﬁrmation from institutional sources (some respondents,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
answered simply “Google”).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Also, several works have been done to explore the methods to combat received by users fake information and convince",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
them with true facts.,,,,In [18] it was shown that explicitly emphasizing the myth and even its repetition with refutation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
help,users,to,pay,attention,and,memorize,the,truth.,"Moreover,",,,participants,,that,received,messages,across,different,,
media platforms [19] and different perspectives of the information [20] showed greater awareness of news evidence.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Consequently, the information from the external search is an important feature for news authenticity evaluation and",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
evidence,,seeking.,,"Also,",a,different,perspective,from,different,,media,,adds,more,conﬁdence,in,the,decision-making,,
process.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2.2,Fake News Detection Datasets,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
To,leverage,the,task,of,automatic,fake,news,detection,,there,have,,been,created,several,news,datasets,focused,on,
"misinformation, each with a different strategy of labeling.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Fake News Challenge3,,,,,launched in 2016 was a big step in identifying fake news.,,,,,,,,,,The task of FNC-1 was stance,,,,,
detection type task [21].,,,,,"The dataset consists of 300 topics, with 5–20 news articles for each.",,,,,,,,,,,"In general, it consists of",,,,
50K labeled claim-article pairs.,,,,,,The dataset is derived from the Emergent project [22].,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Another publicity available dataset is LIAR [23].,,,,,,,,In this dataset 12.8K manually labeled short statements in various,,,,,,,,,,,,
contexts,from,,PolitiFact.com4,,,were,collected.,They,covered,,such,topics,,as,news,"releases,",TV,or,radio,"interviews,"

campaign,,"speeches,",,,etc.,The,labels,for,news,truthfulness,,are,ﬁne-grained,,in,multiple,classes:,"pants-ﬁre,",,"false,"
"barely-true, half-true, mostly true, and true.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Claim,veriﬁcation,,,is,also,related,to,Fact,Extraction,and,VERiﬁcation,,,dataset,(FEVER),,[24].,"185,445",claims,were
"manually veriﬁed against the introductory sections of Wikipedia pages and classiﬁed as SUPPORTED, REFUTED,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"or NOTENOUGHINFO. For the ﬁrst two classes, the annotators also recorded the sentences forming the necessary",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
evidence for their judgment.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
FakeNewsNet,,,[25],contains,,two,comprehensive,,,datasets,that,includes,,news,"content,",,social,"context,",and,dynamic
information.,,,"Moreover, as opposed to all the datasets described above, in addition to all textual information, there is",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
also a visual component saved in this dataset.,,,,,,,,,All news were collected with PolitiFact and GossipCop5,,,,,,,,,crawlers.,,In
"general, 187014 fake and 415645 real news were crawled.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Another collected for supervised learning dataset is FakeNewsDataset [5].,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The authors did a lot of manual work to,,,,,,
collect and verify the data.,,,,,"As a result, they managed to collect 240 fake and 240 legit news on six different domains –",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sports, business, entertainment, politics, technology, and education.",,,,,,,,,,,,,All news samples are for the 2018 year.,,,,,,,
One of the latest large datasets is NELA-GT-2018 [26].,,,,,,,,,,,In this dataset authors tried to overcome some limitations that,,,,,,,,,
can be observed in previous works:,,,,,,,"1) Engagement-driven – the majority of the datasets, both for news articles and",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"claims, contain only data that has been highly engaged with on social media or has received attention from fact-checking",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
organizations; 2) Lack of ground truth labels – all of the current large-scale news article datasets do not have any form,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
of labeling for misinformation research.,,,,,,,,"To overcome these limitations, they gathered a wide variety of news sources",,,,,,,,,,,,
from varying levels of veracity and scraped article data from the gathered sources’ RSS feeds twice a day for 10 months,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in 2018.,,"As a result, a new dataset was created consisting of 713,534 articles from 194 news and media producers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Table 1:,,The datasets covered in related work.,,,,,,,It can be observed that the majority of the data for different fake news,,,,,,,,,,,
detection tasks is for the English language.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Due,to,the,events,of,"2020,",the,work,has,been,already,done,in,the,direction,of,the,creation,COVID-19,fake,news
detection dataset.,,,,COVID-19 Fake News [6] was built based on the information from public fact-veriﬁcation websites,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and social media.,,,,"It consists of 10,700 tweets (5600 real and 5100 fake posts) connected with the COVID-19 topic.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,In
"addition, there was created ReCOVery [29] multimodal dataset.",,,,,,,,,,,,"It also incorporates in itself 140,820 labeled tweets as",,,,,,,,
"well as 2,029 news articles on coronavirus collected from reliable and unreliable resources.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"However, all of the above datasets have one main limitation – they are monolingual and dedicated only to the English",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
language.,,"Talking about other languages other than English, such datasets can be mentioned:",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,French satiric dataset,,
"[32], GermanFakeNC [30], The Spanish Fake News Corpus [31], Arabic Claims Dataset [27].",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"However, all of these",,
"datasets are monolingual as well and mostly cover fake news classiﬁcation tasks missing, for instance, fact veriﬁcation",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and evidence generation problems.,,,,,,,There was only collected A Multilingual Cross-domain Fact Check News Dataset for,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"COVID-19 [33] that covers 40 languages from 105 countries (English, Spanish, French, Portuguese, Hindi languages,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and others).,,,"However, this dataset is highly imbalanced.",,,,,,,,"Firstly, there is a disbalance in terms of fake (4132 samples)",,,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,,3,,,,,,,,,
Multilingual Evidence for Fake News Detection,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and true (1050 samples) labels.,,,,,"Secondly, the number of English samples is signiﬁcantly bigger than for other languages:",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for,the,top,ﬁrst,English,"language,",there,are,over,2000,"samples,",for,the,top,second,Spanish,there,are,almost,1000,
"samples,",,for,the,top,third,French,language,there,are,only,250,"samples,",and,further,data,size,for,other,languages,
decreases dramatically.,,,,,All these statistics also illustrate the difﬁculties of collecting multilingual fake news datasets.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Consequently,",,,the,creation,of,a,supervised,dataset,for,each,language,and,implementation,,,algorithm,of,fake,news,
detection for each language will be a very resource- and time-consuming task.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2.3,Fake News Classiﬁcation Methods,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"On the basis of previously described datasets, several solutions were created to tackle the problem of obtaining such a",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
classiﬁer.,,The feature sets used in all existing methods can be divided into two categories:,,,,,,,,,,,,,1) internal features that can,,,,,
be obtained by different preprocessing strategies and linguistic analysis of the input text; 2) external features that are,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"extracted from some knowledge base, the Internet or social networks and give additional information about the facts",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"from the news, its propagation in social media and users reactions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2.3.1,,Methods based on Internal Features,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One of the types of features that are helpful in fake news classiﬁcation tasks is linguistic and psycholinguistic features.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In [5] a strong baseline model based on such a feature set was created based on the FakeNewsDataset.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The feature set,,,
used in this work looks as follows:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,•,Ngrams:,,tf-idf values of unigrams and bigrams from a bag-of-words representation of the input text.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,•,"Punctuation such as periods, commas, dashes, question marks, and exclamation marks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,•,Psycholinguistic features extracted with LIWC lexicon.,,,,,,,,,"Alongside some statistical information, LIWC also",,,,,,,,,
,,provides emotional and psychological analysis.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,•,Readability,,that,estimates,the,complexity,,of,a,text.,The,authors,use,content,features,such,as,number,of
,,"characters, complex words, long words, number of syllables, word types, and others.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"In addition, they used",,,,
,,"several readability metrics, including the Flesch-Kincaid, Flesch Reading Ease, Gunning Fog, and Automatic",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,Readability Index.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,•,Syntax:,,a set of features derived from production rules based on context-free grammar (CFG) trees.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Based on such features, different statistical machine learning models can be trained.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,In [5] the authors trained the SVM,,,,,,
classiﬁer according to the set of characteristics presented.,,,,,,,,,,"Naïve Bayes, Random Forest, KNN, and AdaBoost were also",,,,,,,,,,
"frequently used as fake news classiﬁcation models [34, 35, 36].",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In [37] the perspective of the usage of emotional signals extracted from the news text for detecting fakes was shown.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The authors analyzed the set of emotions that are present in true and fake news checking the hypothesis that trusted,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
news does not use emotions to affect the reader’s opinion while the fake one does.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,They found out that such emotions,,,,,,
"as negative emotions, disgust, surprise have more tendency to appear in fake news and can give a strong signal for fake",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
news classiﬁcation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Additionally to linguistic features, feature extraction strategies based on deep learning architectures were also explored.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In [38] the classical architecture for text classiﬁcation task based on CNN was successfully applied for the fake news,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
detection task.,,,"With the recent growth of the usage of Transformer architectures in the NLP ﬁeld, such models as BERT",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[9, 39] and RoBERTa [8] also demonstrated high results for general-topic fakes classiﬁcation as well as COVID-19 fake",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
news detection task.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As it can be seen, one of the main advantages of models based on internal feature sets is that such models are quite easy",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
to use and they do not require signiﬁcant additional time for feature extraction.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Moreover, such models can be optimal",,,,,,
in terms of inference time and memory usage because they only operate with internal information from input news.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"However, if we consider the explainability aspect for the end users, the evidence generated from such internal features",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
most likely will be not enough to convince the user of the correctness of model performance and to motivate the label,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
decision for the news.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2.3.2,,Methods based on External Non-Textual Features,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Although internal features-based models can achieve high classiﬁcation scores in the fake news classiﬁcation task, the",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
decision of such is hard to interpret.,,,,,,"As a result, additional signals from external sources can add more conﬁdence to",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
model decision reasoning.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,4,,,,,,,,,,
Multilingual Evidence for Fake News Detection,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"If the news appears in some social network, the information about the users that liked or reposted the news post and the",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
resulted post propagation can be used as a feature for fake news classiﬁcation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,It was shown in [40] that fake news,,,,,,
spread over social networks quicker after the publication than true news.,,,,,,,,,,,,,"As a result, to combat fake news in the early",,,,,,,,
stages,of,its,"appearance,",,several,methods,have,been,created,,to,detect,the,anomaly,behavior,,in,reposts,or,retweets,
"[41,",42].,In,[43],the,different,information,about,speciﬁc,,users,was,explored.,,,The,author,extracted,"location,",proﬁle,,
"image, and political bias to create a feature set.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Another,,type,of,information,that,can,be,obtained,from,users,and,be,used,as,some,kind,of,knowledge,base,is,users’
comments,,related,,to,the,news,post.,This,approach,was,explored,in,[12].,There,was,created,dEFEND,system,,for,
explainable fake news detection.,,,,,,The information from users’ comments was used to ﬁnd related evidence and validate,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the fact from the original news.,,,,,,Factual News Graph (FANG) system from [11] was presented to connect the content of,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"news, news sources, and user interaction to build a full-ﬁlled social picture about the inspected news.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Talking about the information veriﬁcation step in the fake news detection pipeline, there were created several methods",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for leveraging a fact-checking task.,,,,,,One of the sources for providing a knowledge base with evidence is Wikipedia.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The,
FEVER dataset that was previously discussed in Section 2.2 consists of claims and evidence already pre-extracted from,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Wikipedia.,,"Several works like [44, 45, 46] are dedicated to the fact-checking task and evidence generation based on",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Wikipedia pages.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"On the other hand, the knowledge base for obtaining evidence for information veriﬁcation can be simply the Web.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,In,
"[13, 14, 15, 47] the authors referred to the Web search (Google or Bing) to collect relevant articles and use such scraped",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
information as an external feature to build fake news classiﬁer.,,,,,,,,,,,"As it was discussed in Section 2.1, such a Web-based",,,,,,,,,,
feature is quite motivated by real-life users’ behavior.,,,,,,,,,"As a result, the generated evidence based on the Web scraped",,,,,,,,,,,,
information can be more persuasive for the users as it automatizes the steps that they take to check the veracity of the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
news.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"However,",,in,all,the,discussed,methods,we,can,also,see,the,usage,of,only,one,language,for,evidence,granting.,The,
systems that used Web search for evidence extraction turned to only English search results.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"In our work, we want to ﬁll",,,,,
this gap to explore cross-lingual Web-based evidence for the fake news classiﬁcation task.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,Multiverse: A New Feature for Fake News Classiﬁcation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We present Multiverse – Multilingual Evidence for Fake News Detection based on extraction from Web search.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The,
idea is motivated by the user experience illustrated in Section 2.1 and the lack of multilingualism in automatic fake,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"news detection methods, as discussed in Section 2.3.",,,,,,,,,Users quite often refer to the Web search to check news seen in,,,,,,,,,,,,
some news feed.,,,,"However, to show the different points of view and additional information out of a monolingual bubble,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the cross-lingual check of original news can be quite persuasive and can give a larger room for rational judgment about,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
information.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Our proposed approach is based on the following hypothesis:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hypothesis 1 (H1),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,•,"If the news is true, then it will be widespread in different languages and also across media with different biases,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,and the facts mentioned should be identical.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,•,"If the news is fake, it will receive a lower response in the foreign press than a piece of true news.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The step-by-step pipeline of the approach, schematically represented in Figure 1, is as follows:",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,•,Step 1.,,Text extraction:,,"As a new article arrives, the title and content are extracted from it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,•,Step 2.,,Text translation:,,The title is translated into target languages and new search requests are generated.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,•,Step 3.,,Cross-lingual news retrieval:,,,,Based on generated cross-lingual request – translated title – the search,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,with a Web search engine is executed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,•,Step,4,Cross-lingual,,evidence,impact,computation:,,,Top-N,,articles,,from,search,results,are,extracted,to,
,,assess,the,authenticity,,of,the,initial,news.,The,information,,described,,in,the,news,is,compared,with,the
,,information in the articles from the search result.,,,,,,,,"Also, the ranks of the source of the extracted articles are",,,,,,,,,,,
,,taken into account.,,,The number of articles that conﬁrms or disproves the original news from reliable sources is,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,estimated.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,Figure 1:,Overview of our approach:,,,,,checking for fake news based on cross-lingual evidence (CE).,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,•,Step 5.,News classiﬁcation:,,"Based on the information from the previous step, the decision is made about the",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,authenticity of the news.,,,"If the majority of results support the original news, then it is more likely to be true; if",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,there are contradictions – it is a signal to consider the news as a fake.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As we can see from the example in the scheme in Figure 1, for the news “Israel invented a vaccine against coronavirus""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the majority of the scraped articles provide no evidence that supported incoming news.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Moreover, there is an article",,,,,,
with high reliability that provides an explicit refutation of the original information.,,,,,,,,,,,,As there is none of the supporting,,,,,,,,
"information and a contradiction with the scraped information, the probability that we should believe in the veracity of",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this news is quite low.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The proposed method based on cross-lingual evidence extraction can work properly with worldwide important news.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Indeed, if there is some local event about locally famous parties, in the majority of cases such news will be doubtfully",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
widespread all over the Internet.,,,,"As a result, in our future assumptions and experiments, we take into consideration",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
datasets and news that cover worldwide events.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"To incorporate the proposed feature into an automatic fake new detection pipeline, ﬁrstly, we wanted to lean on user",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
experience and check the following hypothesis:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hypothesis 2 (H2),,,The person can detect fake news using cross-lingual evidence using the pipeline presented in Figure,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
After,this,hypothesis,"conﬁrmation,",,we,can,explore,the,possibilities,to,automate,fake,,news,classiﬁcation,,using,,the,
cross-lingual evidence feature conﬁrming the next hypothesis:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hypothesis 3 (H3),,,The proposed cross-lingual evidence feature can improve automatic fake news detection.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
To conﬁrm all the above hypotheses we conducted several experiments.,,,,,,,,,,"For all experiments, we chose top-5 European",,,,,,,,,,
languages,,spoken,in,Europe6,and,used,in,Internet7,–,"English,","French,","German,","Spanish,",,and,Russian,–,to,obtain,

After,the,manual,veriﬁcation,of,the,proposed,"feature,",we,conducted,,the,chain,experiments,,to,validate,,Hypothesis,

5.1,Automatic Cross-lingual Evidence Feature,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Firstly, we implemented the cross-lingual evidence feature according to the steps of the pipeline described in Section 3.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We implemented Algorithm 1 that automatically extracts cross-lingual evidence features for input news.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5.1.1,Cross-lingual evidence retrieval,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
To automate Step 2:,,,"Text translation, we used Googletrans12",,,,,,library.,,"For the translation, we used ﬁve languages as well:",,,,,,,,

extracted only the ﬁrst page of the search result which gave us 10 articles for each language.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5.1.2,Content similarity computation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The goal of Step 4:,,,Cross-lingual evidence impact computation is to ﬁgure out if the information in scraped articles,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
supports or refutes the information from the original news.,,,,,,,To compute this measurement we tested two strategies:,,,,,,,,,1),
similarity computation based on cosine distance between text embeddings; 2) scores based on NLI model.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Cosine,distance,,"Firstly,",we,evaluated,the,similarity,between,two,news,based,on,their,texts’,embeddings.,As,the
"similarity between text embeddings can be interpreted as the similarity between text content, we assumed that such a",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
strategy for content similarity computation can correlate with the fact that one news support information from another,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
one.,"However, there can be cases when the contents of the news can be very close or even duplicated, but the special",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"remarks such as “Fake"", “Rumor"", etc.",,,,,indicate the refutation of the original facts.,,,,,,We took into account such situations.,,,,,,
"As a result, the algorithm for this approach of content similarity computation looks as follows:",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,1,"If the link from the search leads to the ﬁle and not to the HTML page, then the news at this link is automatically",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,considered dissimilar to the original one;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13https://pypi.org/project/Google-Search-API,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,10,,,,,,,,,,
Multilingual Evidence for Fake News Detection,,,,,,,,,,,,
,2,"If there are signs of disproof of news such as the words “fake"", “false"", “rumor"", “lie"" (and their translations to",,,,,,,,,,
,"the corresponding language), negations, or rebuttal, then the news is automatically considered dissimilar to the",,,,,,,,,,,
,original one;,,,,,,,,,,,
,3,"Finally, we calculate the similarity between the news’ title and the translated original one.",,,,,,,For a similarity,,,
,"measure, we choose cosine similarity between sentence embeddings.",,,,,To get sentence vector representation we,,,,,,
,average sentence’s tokens’ embeddings extracted from Multilingual Bert (mBERT) released by [48].,,,,,,,,,If the,,
,similarity measure overcomes the threshold ��,,", then the information described in scraped news and original",,,,,,,,,
,news is considered the same.,,,,,,,,,,,
Natural Language Inference (NLI),,"On the other hand, the task of estimating similarity between news contents can",,,,,,,,,,
be reformulated as Natural Language Inference task.,,,NLI is the problem of determining whether a natural language,,,,,,,,,
hypothesis ��,can reasonably be inferred from a natural language premise ��,,,[49].,,The relations between hypothesis and,,,,,,
"premise can be entailment, contradiction and neutral.",,,The release of the large NLI dataset [50] and later multilingual,,,,,,,,,
XNLI dataset [51] made possible the development of different deep learning system to solve this task.,,,,,,,,,,,,

,Table 3:,Example how NLI model can be used to extract relations between news.,,,,,,,,,,
"The number of classes and their meaning of them in the NLI task is very similar to the labels “Support"", “Refute"" and",,,,,,,,,,,,
"“Not enough info"" that are used for the stance detection task in the fake news detection pipeline and that we used in the",,,,,,,,,,,,
manual markup.,"Moreover, in [52] the usage of NLI features for stance detection task based was tested.",,,,,,,,The best model,,,
based on NLI features showed a 10% improvement in accuracy over baselines on the FNC-1 dataset.,,,,,,,,,The example of,,,
the usage of the NLI model on news titles is presented in Table 3.,,,,,,,,,,,,
We used XLM-RoBERTa-large model pretrained on multilingual XNLI dataset14,,,,,,to obtain NLI scores for pairs “original,,,,,,
news as premise �� ↔ scraped news as hypothesis ��,,,”.,"Also, we generated input in a special format:",,,,,1) the premise was,,,
formulated as “The news “,,,"symbols of content>"" is legit""; 2) the hypothesis was only “",,,,,,,,,
+ ﬁrst ��,"symbols of content>"".",The size ��,of the used content was a hyperparameter of this NLI-based approach for,,,,,,,,,
the news content similarity computation.,,,,,,,,,,,,
5.1.3,Additional features,,,,,,,,,,,
Source credibility,"As it was discussed in Section 2.1, one of the aspects to which users pay attention during news",,,,,,,,,,,
veriﬁcation is the credibility of the news source.,,,"In addition, such a feature about external sources was widely used in",,,,,,,,,
methods described in Section 2.3.,,We as well took into account the credibility of the source from which the piece of,,,,,,,,,,
news comes.,"Following [53], we used AlexaRank for source assessment.",,,,,,,,,,,
Named Entity frequency,,"During the manual experiment, it was discovered that cross-lingual check is more relevant",,,,,,,,,,
"for news about worldwide important events, people, or organizations and not the local ones.",,,,,,,"As a result, to evaluate",,,,,
the worthiness of the news to be cross-lingual checked we:,,,1) extracted NE from the title and the content of news; 2),,,,,,,,,
found the most relevant page on Wikipedia; 3) evaluate AlexaRank of corresponding Wikipedia page to estimate the,,,,,,,,,,,,
popularity of the NE.,,,,,,,,,,,,
5.2,Comparison with Manual Markup,,,,,,,,,,,
"To understand the validity of chosen approaches for content similarity computation between news,",,,,,,,,,we conducted a,,,
small case study on a manually marked-up dataset.,,,"For each approach of news similarity estimation, we calculated the",,,,,,,,,
accuracy of such an experimental setup:,,the classiﬁcation task if the scraped news supports the original news.,,,,,,,,"So, from",,
"manually marked-up data we got a dataset of labeled 1000 pairs “original news ↔ scraped news"".",,,,,,,,,"For each pair, we",,,
transferred from a three-person annotation to a single label by the voting of the majority.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Taking such a setup, we ﬁned-tuned hyperparameters for both approaches.",,,,We ﬁne-tuned threshold ��,,,,for the embeddings-,,,,
based similarity.,"We conducted hyper-parameter search on the segment [0.1, 0.9] with a step ��",,,,,,,= 0.1. The best result,,,,

Multilingual Evidence for Fake News Detection,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
was achieved with the ��,,,,= 0.5 threshold for decision making if the scraped news supports or not the original news.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For NLI based approach, we ﬁne-tuned the length of the text passed as the input to the NLI model.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,We got the best,,,,
hyperparameters setup for the NLI approach is 500 symbols length of news text which is equal to the title of the news,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
with the ﬁrst two paragraphs of the content.,,,,,,,"For the NLI model, we united “neutral"" and “contradiction"" classes to have",,,,,,,,,,,,,
a similar setup as for the embeddings-based approach.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Finally, for cosine distance approach we achieved 82% accuracy, while for NLI",,,,,,,,,,,,,,approach 70% accuracy on 1000 pairs,,,,,,

5.3,Automatic Fake News Detection,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Finally, we conducted a set of experiments to validate Hypothesis 3:",,,,,,,,,,,if the presented cross-lingual evidence feature can,,,,,,,,,
improve automatic fake news detection systems.,,,,,,,,We integrated the automated cross-lingual evidence feature into the,,,,,,,,,,,,
fake news classiﬁcation pipeline tested on three datasets.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5.3.1,,Datasets,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In tested datasets for our automated experiment, we tried to cover several worldwide spread topics – politics, famous",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

from six topics:,,,"sports, business, entertainment, politics, technology, and education.",,,,,,,,,,,,CelebrityDataset is dedicated to,,,,,
"rumors, hoaxes, and fake reports about famous actors, singers, socialites, and politicians.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Secondly, we ran experiments",,,,,

Table 6:,Results of ablation study:,,,,the usage of the best feature sets with cross-lingual evidence (CE) and source rank,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(Rank) compared with the usage of monolingual evidence (ME) and the source rank alongside.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,We can see that the,,,,
performance of only source ranks or monolingual evidence is signiﬁcantly worse than the usage of our proposed feature,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for all datasets.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Chine et en Mongolie & Epidemic"", “Mongolei:",,,,,,,,,"15-Jähriger an Beulenpest gestorben - DER SPIEGEL"", “BROTE DE",,,,,,,,,,,,
"PESTE BUBÓNICA EN MONGOLIA"", “В Монголии произошла вспышка бубонной чумы"".",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Most importantly,",,,,
the,similarity,between,cross-lingual,,,news,content,,,reinforced,with,,the,fact,that,it,came,from,quite,reliable,sources.
"Consequently, as we can see quite enough cross-lingual support from reliable sources to the original news, the probability",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
to believe in this information is quite high.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,Discussion and Future Work,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The,proposed,cross-lingual,,evidence,,feature,,implemented,,,using,described,,pipeline,,in,Section,5.1,can,have,several
limitations.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The main limitation is the work with world-wide important and world-wide spread events.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Unfortunately, our approach",,,,,
will not be applicable for very local news connected with local areas or personalities.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"However, even if the news is",,,,,
only,about,local,famous,"person,",in,any,case,it,can,be,covered,in,news,sources,in,neighbour,countries.,As,a,"result,",
cross-lingual check with neighbour-countries languages can also be useful.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Secondly, the usage of Google services for search and translation steps can bring the bias from personalized system.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,We,
tried to avoid personalization in search by using incognito mode during experiments to hide search history and location,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
parameter.,,"Nevertheless, Google search can use meta information and adjust the resulted feed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"On the one hand, the",,,,
usage of Google services motivated by user search experience.,,,,,,,,,,,"On the other hand, the reproduction of such experiments",,,,,,,,,,
can be quite difﬁcult.,,,In our future work we plan to overcome such issue in the experiments by using already presaved,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
snapshots of search in the Internet for exact period of time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,16,,,,,,,,,,
Multilingual Evidence for Fake News Detection,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As we used automated translation to get the queries for cross-lingual search, there can be another side of this automated",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
translation application – some Internet editions can use automated translation to get the duplication of the news in the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
target language.,,,"Moreover, the method of machine translation are becoming more and more advanced every year.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,As a,,,
"result, we can get the repetition of the news in search results over the different languages.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"However, we believe that our",,,,,,
proposed pipeline can handle such cases as we incorporated in our feature the source rank of the news.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"We believe, that",,,,
for now reliable editions still self-processed text material in their language.,,,,,,,,,,,,But in future work the addition of detection,,,,,,,,
of machine generated texts can be considered.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Another,part,,that,can,be,added,to,the,proposed,cross-lingual,feature,is,the,cross-checking,of,the,information,not,,
only,with,the,original,news,but,also,between,scraped,multilingual,,,evidence.,That,can,add,additional,signals,to,the,
information veriﬁcation process and reveal new details.,,,,,,,,,"Moreover, in this work we used linguistic features calculated",,,,,,,,,,,
only for the original news.,,,,,"However, such features can also be added to the all scraped news in different languages",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
when the appropriate methods will be implemented.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In our presented experiments the original news were presented only in English.,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Moreover, the datasets and information",,,,,,,
noise in the Internet are generally exist in bigger amount for English than for any other language.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,In future work the,,,,,
research should be done to test the proposed feature for news originally presented in different languages other than,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
English.,,"Also, the amount of scraped evidence for language should be somehow normalized according to the overall",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
amount of news that appears for the language.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,Conclusion,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We presented Multiverse – an approach for fake news detection based on cross-lingual evidence (CE) which is motivated,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
by user behaviour and overcome the limitations of monolingual external featured of previous work.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Firstly,",we,conducted,,manual,study,,on,20,news,datasets,to,test,the,hypothesis,whether,the,real-life,user,can,use
cross-lingual,,,evidence,to,detect,fake,news.,The,annotators,successfully,,passed,the,task,of,such,news,veriﬁcation,,
"providing also the markup of 100 pairs “original news ↔ scraped news"".",,,,,,,,,,,,"After the ﬁrst hypothesis conﬁrmation, we",,,,,,,,
tested our approach for automated detection of fake news.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We,experimented,,with,two,strategies,,for,content,similarity,estimation:,,(i),based,on,cosine,distance,between,news,,
texts embeddings;,,,(ii) based on natural language inference (NLI) scores where the original news used as premise ��,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the scraped news as hypothesis ��,,,,,,,.,We compared the proposed strategies with human assessments of 1000 pairs,,,,,,,,,,,,
of,marked,news,showing,,that,these,methods,can,be,used,for,news,similarity,estimation.,"Finally,",we,integrated,the,,
proposed cross-lingual feature into automated fake news detection pipeline.,,,,,,,,,,,,"To this moment, the cross-lingual feature",,,,,,,,
itself showed the performance only at the baselines level.,,,,,,,,,"However, in combination with linguistic features based on the",,,,,,,,,,,
text original news it outperformed both statistical and deep learning fake news classiﬁcation systems.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Additionally, we provided ablation study where the necessity of the usage of cross-lingual evidence with source rank in",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
comparison to only monolingual features was proven.,,,,,,,,,"In the end, we showed how the obtained cross-lingual information",,,,,,,,,,,
can be used for further evidence generation for the end users.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
